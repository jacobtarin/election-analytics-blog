        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This week I will be looking at polls in an attempt to incorporate them into my predictive model of the upcoming midterm elections.
IntroductionIn recent years, especially after the 2016 election, the trustworthiness of polls have come under intense scrutiny. I’m sure we all remember our surprise at Donald Trump winning the election despite nearly every major poll predicting a Clinton victory. While many pollsters cited that the results were withing their established margins of error, spectators were left confused.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This week I’ll be looking at some economic indicators to see if they hold any predictive power over past midterm elections. In particular, I am going to compare three models: one that uses only GDP growth in the last quarter before an election as an independent variable, one that uses only RDI growth in the last quarter before an election, and one that looks at both.
IntroductionHealy and Lenz, among many others, document how the recent performance of the economy is a very good predictor of popular vote share in the presidential election.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This blog post will be the first in a series of posts for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard taught by Ryan Enos. Over the course of this semester, I will be building up my electoral knowledge in order to build a predictive model of the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.
Vote Share and Seat Share by State in the 2020 House ElectionLet’s attempt to visualize past House election data to get a better sense of the past political landscape and warm up my incredibly rusty R skills.
