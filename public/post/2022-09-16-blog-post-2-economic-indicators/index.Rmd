This week I'll be looking at some economic indicators to see if they hold any predictive power over past midterm elections.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(plotly)

```

```{r plotlyTest, warning=FALSE}
cd114 <- st_read("../data/districtShapes/districts114.shp", quiet = TRUE)

# Select Oregon
cd114_or <- cd114 %>% 
  filter(STATENAME == "Oregon") %>% 
  mutate(DISTRICT = as.character(DISTRICT)) %>% 
  select(DISTRICT)

or <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = cd114_or, aes(fill = "blue"), alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_void()

ggplotly(or) %>% 
  layout(xaxis = list(showline = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showline = FALSE))
```
